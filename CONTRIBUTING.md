# Contributing to UMT

Development on the master branch of UMT occurs primarily at a git repository located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  It will periodically be pushed out to the github repo.

Contributors wishing to update UMT should do so by forking this repo, and creating merge requests into the github repo for team members to review.
